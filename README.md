# Pixel Agents

A VS Code extension that turns your AI coding agents into animated pixel art characters in a virtual office.

Each Claude Code terminal you open spawns a character that walks around, sits at desks, and visually reflects what the agent is doing — typing when writing code, reading when searching files, waiting when it needs your attention.

This is the source code for the free [Pixel Agents extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pablodelucca.pixel-agents) — you can install it directly from the marketplace with the full furniture catalog included.

## Features

- **One agent, one character** — every Claude Code terminal gets its own animated character
- **Live activity tracking** — characters animate based on what the agent is actually doing (writing, reading, running commands)
- **Office layout editor** — design your office with floors, walls, and furniture using a built-in editor
- **Speech bubbles** — visual indicators when an agent is waiting for input or needs permission
- **Sound notifications** — optional chime when an agent finishes its turn
- **Sub-agent visualization** — Task tool sub-agents spawn as separate characters linked to their parent
- **Persistent layouts** — your office design is saved and shared across VS Code windows
- **Diverse characters** — 6 diverse characters. These are based on the amazing work of [JIK-A-4, Metro City](https://jik-a-4.itch.io/metrocity-free-topdown-character-pack).

## Requirements

- VS Code 1.109.0 or later
- [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed and configured

## Getting Started

If you just want to use Pixel Agents, the easiest way is to download the [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pablodelucca.pixel-agents). If you want to play with the code, develop, or contribute, then:

### Install from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pablodelucca/pixel-agents.git
cd pixel-agents
npm install
cd webview-ui && npm install && cd ..
npm run build
```

Then press **F5** in VS Code to launch the Extension Development Host.

### Usage

1. Open the **Pixel Agents** panel (it appears in the bottom panel area alongside your terminal)
2. Click **+ Agent** to spawn a new Claude Code terminal and its character
3. Start coding with Claude — watch the character react in real time
4. Click a character to select it, then click a seat to reassign it
5. Click **Layout** to open the office editor and customize your space

## Layout Editor

The built-in editor lets you design your office:

- **Floor** — Full HSB color control
- **Walls** — Auto-tiling walls with color customization
- **Tools** — Select, paint, erase, place, eyedropper, pick
- **Undo/Redo** — 50 levels with Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y
- **Export/Import** — Share layouts as JSON files via the Settings modal

The grid is expandable up to 64×64 tiles. Click the ghost border outside the current grid to grow it.

### Office Assets

The office tileset used in this project and available via the extension is **[Office Interior Tileset (16x16)](https://donarg.itch.io/officetileset)** by **Donarg**, available on itch.io for **$2 USD**.
